## 🕰️ Prologue – Rock Bottom

### 🎓 Graduation Blues
You just graduated high school. No more classes, no more bells—just the crushing weight of adulthood hitting like a brick. You thought you had a plan: university, business degree, the usual path. But rejection letters feel colder than expected.

- 🎯 **Dream School?** Rejected.
- ❤️ **High School Sweetheart?** Dumped you.
- 🏠 **Supportive Parents?** Kicked you out.

Everything that once grounded you vanished in the span of a week.

### 🗑️ The Garbage Bag Life
With nowhere else to go, you stuffed your only real assets—**five pairs of shoes**—into a black garbage bag. They’re not hype, not brand new, but they’re yours. Every pair has a story.

No suitcase. No room. Just:
- 5 pairs of shoes
- The clothes on your back
- A few dreams you’re too stubborn to let die

---

### 😓 Temporary Shelter
Your best friend gives you a place to crash—**for one night only**. You spend that night scrolling resale apps, looking at what those same shoes could be worth if cleaned, packaged, and flipped right.

By morning, they hand you:
- A **spare beat-up phone**
- A **tiny bit of cash**
- A "good luck" you didn’t ask for

You're back on the street. Broke. Alone. But for the first time in a while, you feel… free.

### 🚀 The Hustle Begins
It’s sink or flip.

You’ve got street smarts, an eye for value, and nothing left to lose.  
The world sees you as another dropout with a garbage bag.  
But you see **inventory**.  
You see **potential**.

Welcome to the grind.  
Welcome to **FLIP**.
