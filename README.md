# Hustle & Flip

**A reselling life sim where you turn secondhand junk into first-class profit.**

> Start with candles. End with custom gaming rigs, rare Pokémon cards, and a sneaker empire. Buy, flip, negotiate, and scale — legally.

## 🕹️ Game Concept

**$FLIP$** is a simulation game where players begin their entrepreneurial journey with nothing but a few bucks and a smartphone. The objective is to build a reselling empire by sourcing items from flea markets, auctions, online classifieds (Kijiji-style), and even drop shipping.

The player can buy low, clean/repair/improve items, and flip them for profit. Mechanics are designed to simulate real-world resale culture — from negotiating prices, identifying rare collectibles, to handling scams and competition.

- **Jewelry** (watches, chains, rings — real or fake)
- **Accessories** (phones, bags, custom sneakers)

Some rare cosmetic items can only be earned through milestones or limited-time market drops.
